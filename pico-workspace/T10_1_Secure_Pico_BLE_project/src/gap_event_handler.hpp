/**
 * @brief Example bridge between asynchronous GAP callbacks and the project
 * application logic.
 *
 * This class represents one possible design for tracking link state in the
 * project. It is intentionally small: it does not implement service logic,
 * but only translates GAP connection events into application-visible state.
 *
 * This is the same GAP-side bridge pattern used earlier in the course:
 * Module 7, "GAP on Pico 2 W", introduces the GAP event-handler structure for
 * advertising, connection, and disconnection flow; Module 8, "GATT on Pico 2
 * W", reuses it to connect GAP events to the AttributeServer; and Module 9,
 * "BLE Security on Pico 2 W", keeps the same event-handler structure while
 * adding Security Manager related initialization around the secured server.
 *
 * In this design, the object:
 * - stores a pointer to the GAP interface so advertising can be restarted,
 * - stores a pointer to the AttributeServer so the active connection handle
 *   can be propagated after connection, and
 * - caches a simple connected/disconnected flag for the main application
 *   task.
 *
 * The object may be constructed before the GATT database is enabled. In that
 * case, the AttributeServer pointer is injected later through
 * @ref SetAttributeServer once the parsed database has been enabled and the
 * server object is available.
