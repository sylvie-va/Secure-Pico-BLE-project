/**
 * @brief Example adapter for the Security Manager callbacks used in the
 * project.
 *
 * This class shows one possible way to keep pairing and authorization related
 * callbacks separate from the main application task. The project does not
 * require this exact class structure, but the design makes the security flow
 * explicit and keeps the callback implementations close to the
 * @ref c7222::SecurityManager object they operate on.
 *
 * In the course progression, this follows the same event-handler separation
 * used in earlier modules. Module 7, "GAP on Pico 2 W", introduces dedicated
 * GAP callback helpers, Module 8, "GATT on Pico 2 W", continues the same idea
 * with GAP and characteristic event handlers, and Module 9, "BLE Security on
 * Pico 2 W", applies the same pattern directly to Security Manager events.
 *
 * In this design, the object contains:
 * - a pointer to the enabled SecurityManager instance,
 * - callback overrides for the pairing procedures used by the project, and
 * - callback overrides for authorization and re-encryption reporting.
 *
 * The object may be default-constructed before BLE security is enabled.
 * After @ref c7222::Ble::EnableSecurityManager returns the runtime
 * SecurityManager object, that pointer is stored through the constructor or
 * @ref SetSecurityManager. The callback implementations can then confirm
 * pairing steps or grant authorization through that stored pointer.
